bio: |
  I am a graduate student in Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, with a strong background in Computer Science. My work focuses on diffusion models, computer vision, and learning-based system modeling. 
  I have experience building end-to-end research projects, from mathematical formulation and algorithm design to implementation and evaluation. 
  I am interested in research problems that connect modeling, optimization, and real-world systems.
