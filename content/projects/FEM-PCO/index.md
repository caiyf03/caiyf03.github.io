## Overview
This project studies **PDE-constrained optimization** for heat conduction problems by combining **finite element discretization** with **convex optimization** techniques. The implementation is a **Computational Science and Engineering** course final project completed in **June 2024**.

## What we did
- Focused on a **Simultaneous Analysis and Design (SAND)**-style approach for PDE-constrained optimization.
- Built FEM-like numerical pipelines to solve **three sequential predictive problems** in heat conduction.
- Addressed practical inverse/control-style tasks, including:
  - fitting temperature distributions
  - inferring/predicting internal heat sources

## Methods & context
- FEM discretization + optimization loops inspired by the course FEM chapter and numerical optimization material.
- Extended study notes toward **FETI (Finite Element Tearing and Interconnect)**-related literature (as a reading extension).
