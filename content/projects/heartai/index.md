## Overview
**HeartAI** is an AI agent designed to interact with a simulated “Heart Rate Game” environment.  
This project was developed as part of the **ShanghaiTech course project** requirement and explores **reinforcement learning** applied to physiological/game control tasks.

## Key Features
- Designed a reward function balancing game score and heart rate control
- Implemented RL agents with custom observation and action spaces
- Evaluated multiple policies under different player states

## Methods
- **Environment setup:** Custom game simulation code
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Policy gradient / Q-learning / PPO (根据实际写)
- **Evaluation:** Win rate, stability of heart rate over episodes

## Results
- Trained agents able to maintain stable heart rates while maximizing score
- Visualization of agent trajectory and heart rate curves
